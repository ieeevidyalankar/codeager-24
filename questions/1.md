# Part 1: "A is A, however..."

To find all artifacts you first need to locate them. Using the Protagonist's unique ability of precognition, you have located a scroll which is said to have more information about each artifacts. The scroll is hidden in a cave outside the capital city of Wordsworth. After a journey of several days, you have located the scroll. However, the writing on the scroll is seemingly unintelligible.

"What is this gibberish", was the initial reaction of the Protagonist. 

Upon closer inspection you notice that the writing seems to be some kind of coded text. The first line of the scroll says,

`A +- IV`

Using this information, help the Protagonist find the location of the artifacts by decoding the message.
