# Part 5: Somewhere, Under A Starry Sky

The next bit of your journey takes you to Huxley, an astronomical observatory on the edge of the continent. At the observatory you are welcomed by a robot with a penchant for blabbering.

"Welcome to the Huxley Observatory, the only place on the continent where you can watch Orwell's Comet in all its glory!"

Orwell's Comet was a long orbit interstellar comet which visited the planet every 37 years. The observatory was the best spot to watch it, since it was located at a high altitude and close to the shoreline, away from the light pollution in the hinterland of the continent.

The strange robot continued to chatter about seemingly unrelated topics, much to the annoyance of the Protagonist. Finally, the robot hands you an old book which contains records of each year the comet had visited the planet. Along with the year, there was also a record of the distance of the comet from the surface, calculated using simple trigonometry.

Find the year of the closest approach of the comet.
