# Part 6: The Leaning Tower of Babel

*A building has integrity, just like a man - and just as seldom.*

As you recover from your journey to Huxley, the Protagonist rushes you to the next station in the journey. The 5th artifact is located in an unnamed country, which is really the size of a small city. The city has a hexagonal shape, with a tall tower at its center. The tower has a peculiar design; despite leaning outward at an outrageous angle, it seemed remarkable stable. 

The tower also has floors below the ground level. The artifact is hidden on a particular floor of the building. To access that floor, one must follow a certain pattern of input. There are 3 buttons, pressing the 'Ж' key takes you up by a floor, while pressing the 'ळ' key takes you down by a floor. There's also the 'ψ' key, which does nothing, and the 'ඞ' key which causes you to skip a single floor.

Your tour guide validates your possession of the other artifacts and punches in a sequence of keys to take you to the floor where the artifact is hidden. 

Based on the input file provided, calculate what floor are you going to end up on.
