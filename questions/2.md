# Part 2: "Old Home"

Having located the scroll and identified the first artifact's whereabouts, the Protagonist moves with renewed vigor towards the location of the first artifact. In the walled city of Glie, you meet an old man who introduces himself as the Communicator. He takes you to the location of the artifact, an abandoned factory in the western section of the city.

"The artifact is located within the inner premises of this factory. Near the warehouse, you will find a chamber with the artifact enclosed within it. If you try to break the chamber, it will self-destruct along with the artifact. Next to it are 5 different types of orbs. Each set of orbs has an amount of mana associated with it. On the right side, you will find 20 slots where you must place the orbs. To open the chamber, the total mana value of the orbs placed must be as high as possible."


Orb Type | Number of Orbs | Total Mana Value 

Red         | 6         | 27                

Blue        | 1         | 10.8              

Green       | 11        | 24.2              

Yellow      | 7         | 27.3               

Black       | 4         | 18.7
