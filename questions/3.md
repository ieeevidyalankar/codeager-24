# Part 3: "Late Late says the White Rabbit"

After securing the first artifact, you head to the next location. As you pass the entrance to a small forest, you stop in front of a strange sign. It guides you to a small cottage where you are accosted by a rabbit.

"I am the guardian diety of this forest. The artifact has been with me for millennia. I was looking for someone to take my burden, but first I must see whether you are worthy enough."

"Whatever challenge you give me, I will fulfill it in no time", the Protagonist confidently asserts.

The rabbit hands you a giant sheet of seemingly random numbers, and asks you to find the largest and smallest among them. Help the Protagonist secure the artifact by writing an algorithm to do so. After finding the largest and smallest number, find the **difference** between the two and submit it as the answer.
