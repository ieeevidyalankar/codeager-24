# Part 7: Snowy Mountain Syndrome
The Protagonist's excitement continues to increase as she reaches the idyllic mountains of Arrakis. The sixth artifact is locked inside a leaden chest, which is tied shut with a rope. The chilly wind makes you shiver as you begin reading the inscription on the chest,

"Who disengages this knot must give and hazard all thou hath, and shall get as much as thou deserveth, open this chest and thou shall gain many a desire. For this is the will of the gr-"

CLACK!

While you were busy reading the inscription to untangle the knot, the Protagonist took out her battleaxe and ripped the knot in two.

"We got no time for that, just open the stupid thing," was her answer.

Inside the box, there is a manuscript filled with jumbled words separated by spaces. The words may seem illegible because they are written in Elvish. Each line forms a sentence, but to ensure security, a valid sentence must contain no duplicate words.

For example, `foo zoz wink bar` is valid, but `foo zoz bar wink bar isn't`.

Find the number of valid sentences to unlock the true meaning of the manuscript and secure the artifact.
