# Part 4: Meet the WIZARD!
You decide to visit the village on Klapka in the Central plains. The third artifact is said to be with a wizard with a distinctive lightning mark on his face. However, when you visit the location pointed on the map, you are greeted by a peculiar sight. An elf desperately trying to unlock a treasure chest.

Turns out, the elf had taken the artifact from the wizard moments before you arrived. She wanted to use it to unlock the treasure chest. The chest contains a special book of personal significance for the elf. She has challenged you to open the chest without using the artifact. If you are able to open it, she will hand over the artifact to you.

The chest has a state-of-the-art security system. You open the chest and find a manuscript filled with a list of numbers.

"What are these, someone's tax returns?!" the Protagonist remarked sarcastically.

Your task is to check whether each number is divisible by 3, 5, or 7. Maintain a separate counter for each number. The counters must be exclusive of each other. For example, 3535 is divisible by both 5 and 7, so it will be considered twice. Sum all three counts and enter it as your answer to unlock the chest and secure the artifact.
